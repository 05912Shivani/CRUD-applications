        <p>This is my project using <b>CRUD</b> application.<br></br>
            <b> CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)</b> operations are typically performed using an API or a backend service to manage the data. The API or backend service is responsible for handling the data storage and retrieval, while the frontend React.js application handles the user interface and logic.<br></br>

Here is a brief overview of how CRUD operations can be implemented in a React.js application:<br></br><br></br>

<b>Create:</b> To create new data, the React.js application can send a POST request to the API or backend service with the new data. The API or backend service can then store the new data in a database or other data storage system.<br></br>

<b>Read:</b> To read data, the React.js application can send a GET request to the API or backend service with the appropriate parameters, such as an ID or a search query. The API or backend service can then retrieve the requested data and send it back to the React.js application.<br></br>

<b>Update:</b> To update existing data, the React.js application can send a PUT or PATCH request to the API or backend service with the updated data and the ID of the data to be updated. The API or backend service can then update the data in the database or other data storage system.<br></br>

<b>Delete:</b> To delete data, the React.js application can send a DELETE request to the API or backend service with the ID of the data to be deleted. The API or backend service can then remove the data from the database or other data storage system.
